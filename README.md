# The Challenge

A lot of the engineers in HBC love co!ee, although there are definitely di!erences of opinion whether Chemex or an Italian espresso co!ee machine produce the better tasting cup.
Sometimes people will bring an extra co!ee as a surprise for someone else, which can make people VERY happy. We thought it might be nice to make an event of this, called Co!ee Week.
Each person in the engineering department will be assigned someone else in their o"ce to surprise with a co!ee, some time during the week. To be fair, each person will be giving one co!ee and receiving one co!ee during the week. To maximise surprise, nobody will be surprising the person who surprised them.
The engineering departments in Dublin and New York are going to take part to start with.
We’d like you to write a web page that does the random assignment of givers and receivers.
Resources
You can get a list of employees from the endpoint below. You can assume all the engineers want to take part. In reality some don’t actually drink co!ee.
You can get a list of fictional employees from this endpoint:
https://hbc-frontend-challenge.hbccommon.private.hbc.com/co!ee-week/users
The endpoint accepts these optional parameters:
department location
Our design team came up with a wireframe for how it should roughly look on mobile phones and desktops. You need to make it look good on phones, tablets and desktops.
While we love using open source projects, we'd like you to avoid using external libraries for the CSS (e.g. Bootstrap) or for the shu"ing algorithm so we get a better idea of what you can do. Framework such as Angular, Vue, React, etc. are fine.
In HBC our front-end engineers enjoy

- Writing clean code and deploying it to production
- Solving problems. Demonstrate your ability to solve
  problems as part of your solution
- Exploring new technologies and using the latest features
  of Javascript. Use the coding challenge as an opportunity to showcase your knowledge of these.
